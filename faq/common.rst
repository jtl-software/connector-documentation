**Why can I not browse the connector?**

The connector *only* works together with JTL-Wawi. Browsing the URL itself is not indented.

**For which systems can I develop a connector?**

The connector is for the most part indented to synchronize with online shops.

**Which online shops can be connected?**

Basically all shop system can be connected. The decisive factor for some shop systems is the hosting. Cloud hosted
shops e.g. Shopify, 1&1 Shop or Telekom Shop do not grant access to the source in order to upload a connector.
Nevertheless you can try to contact the provider or host the connector on an own server or web space. In the latter
case you have to check if there is a possibility to access the shop systems database directly or via an API to
synchronize the data.
