Core
====

The official implementation of the protocol used by JTL-Connector and JTL-Wawi.
You are free to use this library in your endpoint implementations and if they are written in the PHP programming language its use is strongly recommended to stay compatible with future versions of JTL-Wawi.

The source code is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/jtl-software/connector-core>`_
