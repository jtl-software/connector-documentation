Endpoint
========

Endpoint is an synonym for the platform/shop system for which the connector should be implemented.
The opposite of the endpoint is the host which is :doc:`JTL-Wawi </glossary/jtl-wawi>`.
Especially in the Identity objects you can see the differentiation.
There is an endpoint id which is the object's id in the platform and an host id which is the id in :doc:`JTL-Wawi </glossary/jtl-wawi>`.
