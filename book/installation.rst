   single: Installation

Installation
============

The Sylius main application can serve as end-user app, as well as a foundation
for your custom e-commerce application.

This article assumes you're familiar with `Composer`_, a dependency manager
for PHP. It also assumes you have `Composer installed globally`_.

.. note::

    If you downloaded the Composer phar archive, you should use
    ``php composer.phar`` where this guide uses ``composer``.


It can be installed using two different approaches, depending on your use case.

Install to Contribute
---------------------

To install Sylius main application from our main repository and contribute, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ composer create-project -s dev sylius/sylius

This will create a new sylius project in ``sylius``. When all the
dependencies are installed, you'll be asked to fill the ``parameters.yml``
file via interactive script. Please follow the steps. After everything is in
place, run the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Move to the newly created directory
    $ cd sylius
    $ php app/console sylius:install

The ``sylius:install`` command actually runs several other commands, which will ask you some questions and check if everything is setup to run Sylius properly.

This package contains our main Sylius development repository, with all the components and bundles in the ``src/`` folder.

For the contributing process questions, please refer to the `Contributing Guide <http://docs.sylius.org/en/latest/contributing/index.html>`_.

Bootstrap A New Sylius Project
------------------------------

To create a new project using Sylius Standard Edition, run this command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ composer create-project -s dev sylius/sylius-standard acme

This will create a new Symfony project in ``acme`` directory. When all the
dependencies are installed, you'll be asked to fill the ``parameters.yml``
file via interactive script. Please follow the steps. After everything is in
place, run the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Move to the newly created directory
    $ cd acme
    $ php app/console sylius:install

This package has the whole ``sylius/sylius`` package in vendors, so you can easily updated it and focus on your custom development.

Accessing the Shop
------------------

In order to see the shop, access the ``web/app_dev.php`` file via your web
browser.

.. tip::

    If you use PHP 5.4 or higher, you can also use the build-in webserver for
    Symfony. Run the ``php app/console server:run`` command and then access
    ``http://localhost:8000``.
