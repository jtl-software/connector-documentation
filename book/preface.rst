Preface
=======

Thank you for your interest in JTL-Connector.
This book will guide you through the internals of JTL-Connector and enables you to use JTL-Connector to connect JTL-Wawi to arbitrary platforms.

To provide you with realistic programming examples our code snippets assume that you are developing an endpoint that targets the fictitious shop software "ACME Shop", developed by the also fictitious software vendor "ACME Inc.".
All code snippets and example namespaces are named accordingly.

.. note::
    Choose your namespaces based on your company's name and the target software system you want to address with your endpoint.
    Consider the `PSR-0 <https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0-autoloader.md>`_ and `PSR-4 <https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-4-autoloader.md>`_ standard documents if you have any questions regarding the naming of PHP namespaces.
